# Offensive Security Notes

### About

I created this book as a reference guide for Offensive Security. I'll keep adding contents. Currently, i am preparing for OSCP 2nd attempt. I hope it can assists you.

Before the beginning, I have to say that, most of contents were copy/pasted from other resources. And I add the reference all the time.
