# Offensive Security Notes

### About

I created this book as a reference guide for Offensive Security. I'll keep adding contents. I hope it can help you.

Before the beginning, I have to say this, most of contents were copy/pasted from other resources. And I add the reference all the time.

### Contact

You can contact me anytime. I am open for any feedbacks or changes. Keep hacking!
