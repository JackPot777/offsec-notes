I faced with 2 exam structures in about 3 months. This post will contain only comparison. You can reach preparation and detailed information in this post:

As you know, there were 5 machines in previous exam structure.

Distribution: 1 BOF, 1x25, 2x20, 1x10.

BOF and easy machine usually were in our pocket. Cause of they could be easily exploit. So, you had get 35 points to pass. In addition to these, you could get extra 5 points with exercises and 10 lab machines reports.

There are 6 machines in new exam structure. 3 of them in an AD chain.

Distribution: ADx40, 3x20

There is an important point here, you can get 40 points in a row. They do not give partially. So, you must take one domain. In addition to these, you can get extra 10 points with exercises and 10 lab machines report.

Differences:

\-          You must know post exploitation steps to take over domain. It is necessary.

\-          It is harder.

\-          Extra 10 points are important for new exam structure.

\-          BOF is not certain

You can pass the exam with:

3x20 points, exercises and 10 lab machines report

Or

Taking over domain

&#x20;

My experience, the exam harder, it got more realistic. The initial access is tricky and hard for AD chain. You must prepare more than the previous one.



Thanks for reading.
