# PWK Labs vs PG Practice

Hello everyone,

I would like to touch on the differences between PWK lab and PG Practice. I solved 75 machines in PWK lab. Also, I solved about 70 machines on PG Practice. I have never experienced PG Play.

The difference between them is not very well known. I want to tell as much as I can. I've listed the pros and cons below. I hope it will be enlightening.



**PWK Lab:**

\+ Active Directory Chains

\+ You have to do post exploitation

\+ There are different Client Side Attack vectors than in PG Practice

\+ Lots of dependent machines

\+ Network Pivoting

\+ Target corporate network

\+ Finding solutions to problems encountered on the student forum

\+ Finding tips on the student forum (reading all posts :/)

\+ Having ready-to-use win, debian, dc clients for the user

\- Up to date

\- No walkthrough

\- Shared network

\- Few BOF practices

\- Need to revert the machine, before starting work on the machine

\- You need to wait short time to start all services on the machine.



**PG Practice:**

\+ Up to date

\+ Lots of variety

\+ Non-shared network, private network

\+ Affordable monthly fee

\+ Ability to open a walkthrough of the Machine at any time for 0 point (1 time in 24 hours)

\+ In exchange for points, you can get hints fo Enumeration, Initial Shell, RCE, Privesc etc. (daily limit available)

\+ Difficulty classifications available

\+ There are many machines prepared by Offensive Security

\+ There are machines created by different people.

\+ Revert is much faster

\+ The machine starts at the same time as its services

\+ I think the network is faster

\+ I think, it's content is more difficult than the PWK lab environment

\+ There are machines that require lateral movement

\+ There are machines that require code review

\- Only kali client available (like tryhackme)

\- No post exploitation

\- No dependent machines

\- No AD chain (but there are 3 different DC machines)

\- No network pivoting

\- Few BOF practices

\- Ability to use only 1 target machine at the same time
